Compilation on Linux:

 * Install GCC and C++ support for GCC.
 * Download the latest version of BOOST distribution from http://boost.org and unpack it to some directory (e.g. /usr/src/boost_1_55_0).
 * Set BOOST_ROOT environment variable to point to the root directory of the unpacked BOOST distribution (e.g. export BOOST_ROOT=/usr/src/boost_1_55_0).
 * Go to spdaemon build directory: spdaemon/build/linux.
 * Invoke build32.sh script to build project targeted for 32-bit operating environment.
 * Invoke build64.sh script to build project targeted for 64-bit operating environment.

Note: in order to build 64-bit version of spdaemon you will need to additionally install 64-bit version of GCC.

If there were no errors during the build process, then you can find resulting spdaemon executable in spdaemon/bin directory.

 * Set BOOST_ROOT environment variable to point to the root directory of the unpacked BOOST distribution.
 * Go to spdaemon build directory: spdaemon/build/windows.
 * Invoke build32.bat script to build project targeted for 32-bit operating environment.
 * Invoke build64.bat script to build project targeted for 64-bit operating environment.

Note: in order to build 64-bit version of spdaemon make sure that your setup of Microsoft Visual Studio contains compiler and tools for 64-bit environment.

If there were no errors during the build process, then you can find resulting spdaemon executable in spdaemon/bin directory.
